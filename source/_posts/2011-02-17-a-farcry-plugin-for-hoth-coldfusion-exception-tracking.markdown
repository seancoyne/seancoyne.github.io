Just a quick note to mention that I have released a FarCry plugin for the Hoth exception tracking framework. If you are interested take a look at the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/seancoyne/farcryhoth) and let me know what you think.
I have also included a zip file of the code attached to this entry.
